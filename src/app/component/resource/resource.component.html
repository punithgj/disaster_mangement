            <h2>Hurricanes</h2>
            <p>
                Hurricanes are powerful tropical storms that can cause widespread damage through high winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. They can lead to severe flooding, infrastructure destruction, and loss of life. Proper preparation, including securing property and having evacuation plans, is crucial to minimize their impact.

            <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
            <p>
                Earthquakes result from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, causing ground shaking and potential destruction. They can trigger landslides, tsunamis, and infrastructure collapse. Understanding safety measures, such as "Drop, Cover, and Hold On," can save lives during such events.

            <h2>Wildfires</h2>
            <p>
                Wildfires are uncontrolled fires that spread rapidly, especially in dry and windy conditions. They can devastate large areas of forest, homes, and wildlife habitats. Community awareness, proper land management, and having evacuation routes are key to preventing and controlling wildfires.

            <p>
                Tornadoes are violently rotating columns of air that extend from thunderstorms to the ground. They can cause significant destruction with their high wind speeds. Quick action, knowing safe shelters, and having a reliable warning system can greatly reduce the risk of injury during a tornado.

            <p>
                Tsunamis are large ocean waves typically caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. They can travel at high speeds and cause catastrophic flooding when they reach coastal areas. Early detection systems and evacuation plans are essential to protect coastal communities.
